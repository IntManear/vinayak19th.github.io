      This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning. Topics include: 
        
      - _Supervised learning_ - parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks 

      - _Unsupervised learning_ - clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning 

      - _Best practices in machine learning_ - bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI 
      

      The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning 
      algorithms in many cutting edge practical circumstances.

      This course teaches you learn how to train and run machine learning models in any browser using TensorFlow.js. 
      You’ll learn techniques for handling data in the browser, and at the end you’ll build a computer vision project that 
      recognizes and classifies objects from a webcam.<br><br>
      I personally incorporated my learning in this course into my internship at Myelin Foundry to test viability of project 
      deployment in Tensorflow.js for web browser based inference. This was done for multiple projects.

      This course teaches you how to use a suite of tools in TensorFlow to more effectively leverage data and train your model. 
      You’ll learn how to leverage built-in datasets with just a few lines of code, use APIs to control how you split your data, 
      and process all types of unstructured data. <br><br>
